MuniAlert provides a reporting module that lets users to inform other barangay on the current situation and occurrences. The  application also provide announcement module that can be seen  through the system for  warning or new information. This design able to offer real-time reports on the status of the monitoring plans, as well as ensure that barangay authorities are appropriately informed and prepared to manage crisis without listing the information manually.

Recognizing that natural phenomenon impacts are already being felt, DisasterTrack implements natural occurences plans. This includes measures to report information to the event such as flood, earthquake, or wildfire and developing early warning system information for such  events.
